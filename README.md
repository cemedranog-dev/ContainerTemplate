# Container Template

This is a template for configuring a basic Rails Application with SQLite using [Visual Studio Code Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

This repo will include the configurations for:

* `Rails v 6` remote container with `ruby v 2.7.1`.
* `Docker Compose` in case you want to run the project without remote containers.
* Configuration for `solargraph` and `rubocop` vscode extensions.

## Work to be done

* Add configuration for run with postgres and redis
